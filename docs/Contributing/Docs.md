# Docs
The Enarx project welcomes contributions!

This very documentation you are reading takes time and effort to maintain and
improve. Any help here is very welcome.

Here are some ways you can contribute:
- reporting (or even fixing) any broken links you find
- reporting  what you think doesn't make sense
- reporting what you think is missing
- reporting  on how easy or hard it is to find the "right" information (are
things organised in a logical way?)

To report this, you may use the issue tracker or come talk to us (cf. general "[how to
contribute](Introduction)" page).
