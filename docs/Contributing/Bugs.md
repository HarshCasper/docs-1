## Code of Conduct
The Enarx project aims to be a welcoming and inclusive community, and to this
end adheres to and enforces the Contributor Covenant code of conduct. You can read it
[here](https://github.com/enarx/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Issues and Bugs
All our work takes place in the main [enarx/enarx](https://github.com/enarx/enarx) repo. We track different areas of focus via issues and PRs organized into repository projects:
* [SGX](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/projects/3)
* [SEV](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/projects/4)
* [WebAssembly](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/projects/8)
* [Infrastructure](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/projects/6)

We also have a few other boards to track non-technical work:
* [Conferences](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/projects/1)


### Issue labels
To keep our work organise, we make heavy use of labels. These allow us to quickly see all issues relating to conferences, infrastructure or WebAssembly, for instance.
Here are the labels we use:
