  "description": "Enarx needs to support Keeps that are built on encrypted virtual machine technologies such as AMD SEV and IBM Power PEF. This means that we need to boot an operating system inside the guest virtual machine. However, existing operating systems do not meet the Enarx design principles (especially: minimal trusted computing base [TCB], external network stack and memory safety). Therefore, this page outlines a plan for building a minimal operating system which intends to service only the minimal requirements to run Enarx.",
