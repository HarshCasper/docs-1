  "description": "A TEE is Trusted Execution Environment.  We (Enarx) define a TEE as \"a hardware-based technique for securing sensitive data and algorithms in such a way that even the kernel, root user or hypervisor can't see what's going on.\"  Examples are AMD's SEV, Intel's SGX and IBM's PEF.  When you need to secure a workload using TEE technology on a host machine, you create a TEE instance.  Intel's SGX calls this an \"enclave\", AMD's SEV calls this a \"secure VM\".  We call it a \"Keep\".",
