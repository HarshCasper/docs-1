  "title": "Protecting data on public clouds and edges with confidential computing",
  "description": "Many CISOs, CSOs, and CIOs continue to struggle to protect data from sophisticated cross-cloud orchestration and cross-tenant attacks, among others. It’s a modern variation of a familiar challenge: balancing security and privacy with usability. While placing and processing intellectual property on shared servers is fraught, experts say the risk can and must be managed. That’s the aim of a new cross-industry effort, the Confidential Computing Consortium. Founded in 2019, the collaboration operates within The Linux Foundation. Its mission is defining and promoting adoption of confidential computing, which protects sensitive data within system memory, a new favored target for attackers. Backers include industry heavyweights Alibaba, ARM, Baidu, Google Cloud, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, and Tencent.",
