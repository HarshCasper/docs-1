  "title": "Panel Discussion: Evolving the Confidential Computing Consortium: Non-profit Collaboration for Growth",
  "description": "The Confidential Computing Consortium launched under the Linux Foundation umbrella two years ago. It continues to grow and thrive. This panel looks at why various partners joined and continue to join, the deal for partners, the challenges of managing a non-profit, and the importance of establishing culture early. It tackles it from multiple perspectives (start-ups and well established public companies, and levels of membership). The panel participants have broad experience across a number of non-profit organizations in the broad open source community. The group also represents a diversity of perspectives of the workings of the committees of the Consortium.",
