  "title": "Analyzing Trends of Commoditized Confidential Computing Frameworks for Implementing Trusted Execution Environment Applications",
  "description": "Recently, Confidential computing plays an important role in next-generation cloud technology along with the development of trusted execution environments(TEEs), as it guarantees the trustworthiness of applications despite of untrusted nature of the cloud. Both academia and industry have actively proposed commercialized confidential computing solutions based on Intel SGX technology. However, the lack of clear criteria makes developers difficult to select a proper confidential computing framework among the possible options when implementing TEE-based cloud applications. In this paper, we derive baseline metrics that help to clarify the pros and cons of each framework through in-depth comparative analysis against existing confidential computing frameworks. Based on the comparison, we propose criteria to application developers for effectively selecting an appropriate confidential computing framework according to the design purpose of TEE-based applications.",
