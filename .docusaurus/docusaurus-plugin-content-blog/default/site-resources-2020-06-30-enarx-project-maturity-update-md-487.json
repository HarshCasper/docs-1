  "description": "It’s been a busy time since we announced Enarx and our vision for running workloads more securely to the world in August 2019.  At the time, we had produced a proof of concept demo, creating and attesting a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) instance using AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) capability, encrypting a tiny workload (literally a few instructions of handcrafted assembly language) and sending it to be executed.  Beyond that, we had lots of ideas, some thoughts about design, and an ambition to extend the work to other platforms.  And since then, a lot has happened, from kicking off the Confidential Computing Consortium to demos with AMD’s SEV and Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX), from contributor improvements to the recent efforts to provide a Wasm module for multiple silicon vendor architectures.",
